# Little Lemon Project

Hi, my dear pear reviewer!

Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I wanted to provide a bit of context before you begin:

This is a standard React application that includes core features such as a Home page, a Table Reservation page, form validation, and a confirmation screen. While the app covers all the key requirements of the course project, I did not strictly follow the design and coding patterns from the Meta course materials. As a result, some implementations—especially in the later stages such as unit testing—may differ from the examples shown in the course.

Additionally, certain pages or UI components may look slightly different from those presented in the lessons. However, the app retains the required functionality and demonstrates an understanding of the core concepts.
